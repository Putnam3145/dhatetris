I only wrote it with the guidelines on the wiki and a vague knowledge of what to do, mind, so it's probably weirder. For one, this version allows holding and T-spins and things, which might lead to "better play".

Uses [arsd](https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd/) for its game stuff; a bit has been added to arsd/game.d.
